# 365 Days of Cybersecurity

This repository documents my 365-day journey learning cybersecurity from the ground up, with a strong focus on hands-on practice, Red Team skills, and real-world scenarios using TryHackMe.

The goal of this project is to build a solid technical foundation, develop practical offensive security skills, and create a public learning portfolio.
