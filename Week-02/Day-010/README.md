# Day 10 – Cyber Security 101: Start Your Cyber Security Journey 🚀

## 🎯 Objective
Transition from PreSecurity to Cyber Security 101 by understanding the fundamentals of offensive and defensive security, developing a security mindset, and learning how to effectively search and analyze publicly available security-related information.

---

## 🔴 Offensive Security
- Attacker mindset and goals
- Identifying and mapping attack surfaces
- Importance of reconnaissance before exploitation
- Understanding that most attacks begin with information gathering
- Difference between automated attacks and targeted attacks

---

## 🔵 Defensive Security
- Prevention, detection, and response concepts
- Blue Team responsibilities and workflows
- Importance of visibility, logging, and alerting
- Understanding how attackers bypass weak defenses

---

## 🧠 Red Team vs Blue Team
- Red Team: simulate real-world attacks to identify weaknesses
- Blue Team: monitor, detect, and respond to threats
- Purple Team: collaboration between Red and Blue teams
- Why understanding both perspectives is critical for effective security

---

## 🔍 Search & Research Skills (Critical Skill)

Learning how to **search, correlate, and validate information** is a core cybersecurity skill.

### 🌐 Search Engines & Techniques
- Advanced Google dorks
- Targeted searches for vulnerabilities, CVEs, and misconfigurations
- Understanding how much information is publicly exposed

### 🛰️ OSINT & Security Platforms
- **Shodan** – Discover exposed services, ports, and devices
- **Have I Been Pwned** – Check for breached accounts and leaked credentials
- **VirusTotal** – Analyze files, URLs, IPs, and domains
- **CVE Details / NVD** – Research known vulnerabilities
- **Exploit-DB** – Public exploits and proof-of-concepts
- **GitHub** – Search for tools, exploits, and misconfigurations
- **Reddit / Twitter (X)** – Real-time vulnerability disclosures

### 🧪 Practical Use Cases
- Identify exposed services on the internet
- Validate if a file or URL is malicious
- Research vulnerabilities before exploitation
- Understand attack trends and real-world incidents

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Cybersecurity is more about **thinking and analysis** than tools
- Information is often the weakest link in security
- Strong research skills dramatically reduce dependency on tools
- Enumeration and reconnaissance are the foundation of all attacks

---

## 📌 Progress
- ✔ Cyber Security 101 started
- ✔ Start Your Cyber Security Journey — Completed
