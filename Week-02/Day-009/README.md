# Day 9 – Windows Fundamentals 2 & 3 ✅

## 📘 Overview
Day 9 focused on deepening my understanding of **Windows internals, security mechanisms, and system management**, building a strong foundation for future **enumeration, privilege escalation, and persistence techniques**.

These topics are critical for both **defensive analysis** and **offensive security (Red Team)** operations.
